We need to complete three notebooks:


Bandit Feedback - evaluate organic model with bandit signal.ipynb
- Mostly done...  just explanation

Bandit Feedback - Likelihood based models.ipynb
- pull in  relevant stuff from Likelihood notebooks
- Ask Dmytro about numbers of features
- error bars on click through rates
- best of organic
- best of bandit
- reco with no cross
- personalised reco with cross


Bandit Feedback - IPS based models.ipynb
- Nothing done yet.. write from scratch..
- Before we start what conclusion do we expect?  Contextul bandit wins?  Really?


Why does organic best of do well?
It seems the dot of the embedding with itself causes the popularity to vary..  controlling this may be useful or important, but not trivial.
